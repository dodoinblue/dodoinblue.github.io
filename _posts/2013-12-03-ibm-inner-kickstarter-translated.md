Network World - IBM is readying its fourth internal Kickstarter-like crowdfunding effort over the past year or so to inspire employees to innovate and collaborate, often across departments and the globe.

According to IBM Research member Michael Muller, who spoke this week at the Crowdfunding East conference at the Harvard Faculty Club, IBM has embraced the crowdfunding model popularized in recent years by Kickstarter, Indiegogo and hundreds of other such platforms that match up creators and financial backers from among the masses.

But IBM’s “behind-the-firewall” form of crowdfunding, for which Muller has coined the term “enterprise crowdfunding, is unique in that it isn’t open to the public (though perhaps a hybrid model could emerge some day?).

In an IBM Research crowdfunding experiment held in the third quarter of last year, 500 Watson Research Center employees were each given $100 to invest exclusively in colleagues’ proposals, which ranged from procuring a 3D printer to setting up a disc golf course to recording and sharing seminars. Employee/investors (and anyone else at IBM) could peruse projects showcased on an internal social software program that looks quite like Kickstarter with its individual tiles describing projects and graphical information, such as bars showing funds raised vs. funding goals. Among other things, the effort was designed to inspire and reward a diversity of innovation from the bottom up, rather than leave decisions about which projects are best to the C-level ranks.
