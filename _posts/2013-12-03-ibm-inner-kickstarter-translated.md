Network World - IBM is readying its fourth internal Kickstarter-like crowdfunding effort over the past year or so to inspire employees to innovate and collaborate, often across departments and the globe.

Network World报道 - IBM已经准备好开始它第四轮的内部众筹活动。在过去的一年左右的时间里，IBM试图通过这个类似Kickstarter的公司内部平台激发员工跨部门、跨地区的创新与合作。

According to IBM Research member Michael Muller, who spoke this week at the Crowdfunding East conference at the Harvard Faculty Club, IBM has embraced the crowdfunding model popularized in recent years by Kickstarter, Indiegogo and hundreds of other such platforms that match up creators and financial backers from among the masses.

在上周在Harvard Faculty Club举办的Crowdfunding East会议上，来自IBM Research的Mickael Muller说，IBM已经接受了这个近些年由Kickstarter，Indiegogo和其他众多众筹平台推动而流行的模式。这样的平台可以在众多的发明者和持有资金的支持者之间搭建桥梁。

But IBM’s “behind-the-firewall” form of crowdfunding, for which Muller has coined the term “enterprise crowdfunding, is unique in that it isn’t open to the public (though perhaps a hybrid model could emerge some day?).

但是IBM这个众筹平台是建立在“防火墙”后面的。Muller把它称作“企业众筹”，以区别于向大众开放的众筹平台。（也许有一天会出现一种混合的模式？）

In an IBM Research crowdfunding experiment held in the third quarter of last year, 500 Watson Research Center employees were each given $100 to invest exclusively in colleagues’ proposals, which ranged from procuring a 3D printer to setting up a disc golf course to recording and sharing seminars. Employee/investors (and anyone else at IBM) could peruse projects showcased on an internal social software program that looks quite like Kickstarter with its individual tiles describing projects and graphical information, such as bars showing funds raised vs. funding goals. Among other things, the effort was designed to inspire and reward a diversity of innovation from the bottom up, rather than leave decisions about which projects are best to the C-level ranks.

IBM Research的企业众筹实验在去年第三季度举行。500名Watson Research中心的员工每人有100美元，只能用于投资同事们的各种各样的点子，比如3D打印，setting up a disc golf course，录制和分享专题讲座。员工/投资人（还有其他IBM员工）可以在一个像Kickstarter的内部社交软件上详细了解项目信息。这个软件展示了创意项目的描述，以及项目已经募集到的资金、目标募集资金的额度。这样的设计的众多的好处之一就是激发和奖励自下而上的多样化的创新，而不是把什么是好项目的决定权留在CXO们的手里。

Muller said the research team deemed the crowdfunding effort a success, though has gone on to see subsequent enterprise crowdfunding programs (including one with a $2,000-per-participant spending budget) at IBM do even better. In the Watson Research Center project, some 46% of the employees involved actually did “make a mark on the database” by investing, viewing projects, volunteering to participate in projects or taking other actions, Muller said. They initially spent close to 50% of the $50,000 they were allotted (though that number shrank to about 31% when projects that didn’t meet their funding goals were dissolved).

Muller说，研究小组认为这个众筹实验是成功的，尽管他们看到IBM后续的企业众筹项目（包括一个每人2000美金预算的项目）更加成功。在IBM Watson研究中心的这个项目中，大约有46%的员工以投资、浏览、提供无偿劳动和其他众多方式参与到了项目中。50,000美金的预算中，起初有50%被用于支持创意项目。（但最终因为一些项目未能达到融资目标而解散，最终员工总共花费了31%的预算）

Keep in mind that those making pitches have real jobs at IBM already, so didn’t necessarily have the time or resources to make slick video presentations or run ambitious PR campaigns about their ideas like many who use public crowdfunding sites. Though some IBMers did come up with clever marketing schemes, such as placing a promo about the 3D printer next to the office’s 2D printers. IBM Research also issued newsletters highlighting the crowdfunding program in order to prompt employees to invest the money they’d been given, said Muller.

需要注意的是，这些参与项目的人在IBM是有本职工作要做的，所以他们并没有足够的时间和资源去（像公开众筹平台的项目那样）做漂亮的视频短片或者组织声势浩大的宣传工作。但是一些聪明的IBM员工想出了一些营销策略，比如把3D打印机宣传品放在2D打印机旁边。IBM研究中心也发布了内部通讯来强调众筹项目，让员工尽量把分配给他们的钱投资出去。

Later crowdfunding projects at IBM involving a large IT department and a research center in California attracted even higher participation, spawned dozens of funded projects (including those getting up to $35,000) and revealed interesting results, such as the number of departments whose members invested in projects (nearly eight departments per project in one case) and the high percentage of people who backed projects pitched by people they didn’t know. One program was so successful that it turned out to be underfunded.

后来一个在IBM加利福尼亚的一个大的IT部门和研究中心中进行的企业众筹项目吸引了更多的参与，成功孵化了十几个足额融资的项目（包括一些标的35,000美金以上的项目）。从这个项目中也发现了一些有趣的结果，比如支持一个项目的人来自不同部门的数量（比如8个），比如有很高比例的员工支持他们从未谋面的同事发起的项目。One program was so successful that it turned out to be underfunded.

Those taking part in the crowdfunding programs liked that they were able to hit up peers for funding rather than having to navigate the usual expense controls, and that they were able to propose and fund projects designed to improve corporate culture and staff morale. Muller is hopeful that the projects backed through enterprise crowdfunding will result in further innovation at the company, such as ideas sparked by use of the 3D printer now that employees have their hands on it.

参与过众筹项目的人都喜欢这样的流程：直接从平级的同事处获得资金，而不是通过正常的花费审查，并且可以提出或者支持那些真正能促进企业文化和员工士气的项目。Muller希望哪些被众筹支持的项目可以给公司带来更进一步的创新，比如因为3D打印机项目获得了支持，现在员工可以接触到3D打印，（并在它的基础上创新）。

One audience member asked Muller about whether such internal crowdfunding might be a sort of replacement for programs within companies like Google and at research labs that formerly allowed researchers to spend up to 20% of their time on whatever they wanted – programs that have largely been casualties of tough economic times. Muller said enterprise crowdfunding won’t entirely replace programs like Think Friday within IBM, but does look like a way to do some of that (A Harvard Business Review blogger recently called on companies to use a Kickstarter model to spark innovation, by the way.)

一位现场的听众向Muller问道，这样的内部众筹项目是不是会像Google的20%自由工作时间那样的政策一样在经济不景气的时候被叫停。Muller说，企业众筹和IBM的Think Friday并不一样，但是它确实做了一些Think Friday那样的事儿。（顺便一提，HBR的一篇博客最近号召公司用Kickstarter模式来激励创新）

Muller says he hasn’t heard much about other organizations conducting internal crowdfunding though. “We think we’re the first,” he said.

Muller说，他并没有听说过其他机构进行内部众筹。“我们是第一个吃螃蟹的”他说。

MORE CROWDFUNDING

Earlier at the Crowdfunding East event, attendees were schooled on the latest trends and numbers regarding crowdfunding by Daryl Montgomery, who is wrapping up a book about donation, reward, debt and equity-based varieties of this investment and innovation model. Montgomery said crowdfunding has existed in one form or another for some 2,500 years, and like others speaking at the event said that while crowdfunding is very hot thanks in large part to social media and sophisticated online sites, it also faces regulatory challenges and concerns about controversial (backing Wikileaks) and fraudulent activities.

在Crowdfunding East活动的前期，Daryl Montgomery，一本关于众筹中的捐赠，回报，债务和equity-based varieties（权益衍生品？）的作者，给与会者做了一次演讲。Montgomery说，众筹已经以各种形式存在了2500年左右。虽然现在众筹被社交媒体和成熟网站炒热，但是它仍然面临监管、道德（支持wikileaks维基解密）和不诚信活动的挑战。

“The only limitations to crowdfunding,” he said, “are government regulations and human imagination.”

“只有政府监管和人类想象的局限才能限制众筹的发展“他说。

While Kickstarter and Indiegogo are the best known crowdfunding platforms, many niche platforms exist as well, including those for book authors, charities and hardware makers. Outfits like Launcht make tools that others can use to build their own crowdfunding platforms.

除了最知名的众筹平台Kickstarter和Indiegogo，还有很多其他好的众筹网站，包括那些专门面对作者、慈善和硬件网站。Outfits like Launcht make tools that others can use to build their own crowdfunding platforms.像Launcht那样的Outfits提供工具让其他人可以用来构建自己的众筹平台。

Industry tracker Massolution says more than 800 crowdfunding platforms exist and that participants raised some $2.7 billion through them last year, with that number expected to rise to $5.1 billion this year. While the numbers are eye-popping, those at Crowdfunding East were quick to caution about the overhyping of the market, noting that one in five Kickstarter projects get no funding at all and that plenty of people are really only still learning what crowdfunding even is.
市场追踪机构Massolution说去年总共有27亿美金通过800多个众筹网站被筹集。今年募集的资金有望超过51亿美元。尽管这样的数字令人吃惊，参加Crowdfunding East的人对过分的宣传保持谨慎，因为每5个众筹项目，就有一个项目完全不能募集到钱。大部分的人还不清楚众筹究竟是什么。


Among those taking part on a panel of successful crowdfunders: Mark Bollman at Ball and Buck, whose company sells men’s items, including shirts and wallets; Ronjini Mukhopadhyay, whose PR firm orchestrates crowdfunding campaigns for tech companies like SticknFind; Patty Lennon, who raised funds for a mom-centric conference; and Bruno Sinopoli, whose team at Carnegie Mellon University blew past its $27,000 fundraising goal on Kickstarter to raise $641,000 for UDOO, a Linux-based single-board computer.
参与过成功众筹项目的人有Ball and Buck的Mark Bollman，他的公司卖男士用品，包括衬衫和钱包；Ronjini Mukhopadhyay，他的公关公司帮助想StickFind这样的科技公司推广众筹项目；Patty Lennon成功为一个关于母亲的会议募集了资金；来自卡内基梅隆大学的Bruno Sinopoli和他的团队位自己基于linux的单板电脑项目募集了$641,000,远远超过了它们$27,000的预定目标。

Issues discussed included the fact that you usually can’t just toss an idea onto a crowdfunding site and expect the masses to pile their money into it. It takes a lot of work in terms of reaching out to your contacts, tapping into the community most interested in the topic, investing in a good quality video and more.

会议还讨论了一些其他问题。比如你不能轻易地把一个的创意放到众筹网站上就期待着获得大笔资金的支持。你需要做很多其他的工作，比如像你的熟人寻求帮助，找到对项目最感兴趣的目标受众，并且花钱制作一个漂亮的宣传片，等等。

Sinopoli said the beauty of crowdfunding for CMU was not just the oodles of money, but really the ongoing quality feedback that the UDOO team received during the process from those interested in investing. “The community helped shape the product,” he said.

Sinopoli说，众筹对卡内基梅隆大学的这个项目来说，最重要的不是获得资金支持，而是在众筹的活动中，从有兴趣对项目投资的人那里获得了质量非常高的反馈。他说：“众筹社区帮助我们塑造了这个产品”。
