title: About

I'm a software developer at Sony Mobile, living in Beijing, China. In addition to my work which mainly involves developing android applications that are assigned to me, I like to try new ideas and turn them into prototypes. I'm a big fan of startup theories and I'm looking for people who are eager to test those theories out. In my spare time, I take MOOCs on various subjects, such as engineering, management, finance and law. In summer I like scuba-diving and in winter I ski.
